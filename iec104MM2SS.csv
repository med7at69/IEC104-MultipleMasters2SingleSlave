# If first character of first column in any row of RTUs/System entries is ! Then program will cancel the rest of the rows.,,,,,
# The program will connect each group (by index number) of multiple master SCADA systems to the single slave RTU in same group.,,,,,
# Program will not accept connections from the master SCADA system until connected to the corresponding slave RTU.,,,,,
# Master entries should contain the master SCADA systems information such as port and rtu numbers.,,,,,
# Slave entries should contain the slave RTUs information such as port and rtu numbers.,,,,,
